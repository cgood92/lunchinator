# lunchinator

This is an job interview challenge app.  I have built it to the exact specifications outlined in [these instructions](instructions/instructions.md).  

If I wasn't building to these specific specifications, then I may have built several things differently.  Because of that thought, I have tried to build this app as much "plug-in-play" modules as possible, allowing many things to be easily swapped out.  Please see [the instructions](instructions/instructions.md) file to get an idea of what this app is supposed to do.

Please view this respository as a good example of my coding skills and practices.

## To run

First, create the file `/server/modules/twitterCreds.json`, and save your own Twitter credentials here.  Then, run the command: 

```
npm start
```
